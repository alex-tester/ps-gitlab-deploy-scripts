# ps-gitlab-deploy-scripts
 PowerShell scripts and GitLab CI/CD configuration yaml for deploying the following project types:

- .NET Core
- .NET Framework
- Powershell
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- PowerShell Modules (and deploying to Nuget repo)

Anticipates you are using the powershell executor on Windows based GitLab Runners.

Obviously all of your build tools/sdks must be installed on the runners.
